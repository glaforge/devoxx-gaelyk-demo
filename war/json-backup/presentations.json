Coupling this with JSF, the standard way to create Java EE based web applications, creates some interesting new options in building web applications.

When dealing with task lists, timers and asynchronous messages, it can be a challenge to bind all the hooks and eyes together.

We'll show how easy it is to link this process to your Java domain logic classes.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect of using Activiti is that you get the valuable history analysis reports and audit logs for free.  For example, how many successful deals did we have for each region in less then 20 days.  Or who gave permission for this purchase and what was the motivation.

Immutable instances, small methods without side-effects and small classes are signs of a programmer thinking in Scala, even though Java makes it slightly harder to program that way. \r\nThe pain comes when you got used to Scala's ways of object composition and the often cited closures. \r\nJava let's you do the same things - if you really want to.

While both XML and declarative style has its followers, it also carries its own bag of problems (such as fragile dependancy on String-based bindings, excessive typing of angle brackets known as chevronitis and general inflexibility once the layout gets complicated). This talk is an introduction to an alternative approach, which is programatic instantiation of the UI. While this sounds complicated and tedious at first glance, it is not. This is generic technique, that might be used in any Java-based environment (or elsewhere), but the talk will focus on two prominent frameworks : the bulk of the concepts is explained on Android mobile platform, which is a perfect candidate : mobile UI is typically quite simple, but faces the specific set of challenges, and Android is also - by design - very XML centric, so this talk offers a \"second string\". Another platform mentioned is Google Widget Toolkit to prove the approach presented in this talk can be applied in various stages.\r\nPresentation offers graceful introduction for beginners, as elevant parts of the Android framework are examined (an anatomy of a ViewGroup), while the bulk of talk disserts how leverage the power Java language to create rich, flexible and attractive UI programatically and do it in effective and comprehensible way. Contrasts to traditional, XML-based approach is highlighted, especially in the problematic areas of the original method. More advanced topics are also touched, such as automatic UI generation by introspecting annotated Java object, but the talk remains within the scope of general, beginners to intermediate Java developers audience. The presentation is quite short (within 30 minutes limit) and has several examples and demos of actual, working code. In summary : this talk would give you a food for thought if you intuitively feel there is something wrong with the declarative UI and its linking to the Java code, and also prove that Java is great language even for the front-end coding.",

While these services are familiar, the innovative use of meta-annotations is uniquely expressive and typesafe, and a significant step forward from Seam 2.

Seam extends the CDI programming model by providing portable enhancements, extensions and integrations that tie technologies such as Java Persistence 2 (JPA), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB 3.1), JavaServer Faces 2 (JSF), Business Process Management (BPM), business rules (Drools), reporting (PDF and Excel), security and e-mail templates into a unified full-stack solution, supported by sophisticated tooling.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Pete Muir and Dan Allen, two of the lead Seam developers, detail the state of the union for Seam 3.

At the basis for this course lies the Wicket in Action book, written by the course leader. We'll start with setting up our project, move on from a simple hello world application to implementing an online cheese store. We'll learn to connect it to services delivered by Spring and a back end served with a JPA provider (Hibernate or OpenJPA). During this course we'll cover the end-to-end basics of web application development: unit testing, writing maintainable code, internationalization, security and deployment.",

This talk covers four areas: emergent design enablers, battling things that make emergent design hard, finding idiomatic patterns, and how to leverage the patterns you find. It includes both proactive (test-driven development) and reactive (refactoring, metrics, visualizations, tests) approaches to discovering design, and discusses the use of custom attributes, DSLs, and other techniques for utilizing them.

TDD at the class level is now well understood (if not always well practiced). We find that the benefits we get from writing tests first and using them to drive design apply at the system level too. That's why we try to address integration and system testing as early as possible. The sooner the system is in a deployable state, the better equipped we are to react to changing business needs by delivering new features.\r\n\r\nOur experience is that putting testing at the front of our development process, and paying attention to what we learn from them, flushes out architectural issues such as concurrency and distribution. The result is systems that are easier both to maintain and to support. We can also avoid some of common testing pitfalls, such as unreliability, slow execution, and brittleness.",

Patterns give us a way to tell future developers what our intention was when we built the software.  However, most often, the pattern is not consistently documented.  In this talk, we will show why it is impossible to accurately determine the pattern based on the class structure.  We then introduce a new set of annotations that we use to describe our pattern usage in our code.  We end off with a case study where we annotate the famous junit framework to describe their patterns.  As you will see, our jpatterns.org annotations make the patterns stand out far more clearly, making it easier for experts and novices to work on existing code.",

Some think that actors or transactional memory will save the day by making concurrent programming easier and safer. Even though these are welcome, I am skeptical about their ultimate success. Concurrency is fundamentally hard and no dressing up will be able to hide that fact completely.\n\nA safer and for the programmer much simpler alternative is to treat parallel execution as essentially an optimization. A promising application area are collections. Programing by transforming and aggregating collections is simple, powerful, and can optimized by executing bulk operations in parallel. To be able to do this in practice, any side effects of parallel operations need to be carefully controlled. This means that immutable, persistent collections are more suitable than mutable ones.\n\nIn this talk I will describe the new Scala collections framework, and show how it allows a seamless migration from traditional mutable collections to persistent collections, and from there to parallel collections. I show how the same vocabulary of methods can be used for either type of collection, and how one can have parallel as well as sequential views on the same underlying collection.",

The JEE specification has reached a mature status and a few frameworks dominate the development landscape. This is all good news since the Cloud 2 era requires even more versatile and more scalable back-end technologies.\r\n\r\nA few challenges remain. One of the more pressing challenges is productivity. The development of professional, well documented and tested JEE solutions is done at best at 11 hours per function point (according to International Software Benchmarking Standards Group - www.isbsg.org). This is not a very compelling figure making the development of JEE applications expensive.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary Festa Factory platform stands for the development of JEE applications at the rate of 3 hours per function point, which makes it unmatched in the industry. This talk will be an introduction to the Festa Factory platform. Here some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Better integration of the work of the information analyst and the programmer by using a shared graphical DSL.\r\n* Higher productivity through code generation: no more plumbing and scaffolding code! The Festa Engine currently generates 64 different types of artifacts (classes and configuration files)\r\n* Transparent linear use case based project planning and tracking\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the process of redeveloping the Festa Factory platform and have chosen the Devoxx conference as the launch moment.
