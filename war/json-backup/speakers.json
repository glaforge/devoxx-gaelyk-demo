After returning back to his home country he set up a developer workshop company (7 people) specialized mainly in DB oriented applications. Technologies varied from MS Access to J2EE application deployed on JBoss.  Basically, the company went bankrupt and he moved on. The next step was cca. 4 years spent in a company specialized on DMS solutions. He cycled between senior developer, analyst, architect and team lead positions so he had a chance to wear each hat. In the end he had the feeling he wanted to do something more \"tekkie\" and left for Sun Microsystems. Since 2006 he's been employed by Sun Microsystems as a senior software developer. He's taken part in various projects like NetBeans Profiler, VisualVM (jvisualvm) and JavaFX Editor support.
